def exist( board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
    '''
    Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

    The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

def canFinish(numCourses: int, prerequisites: Sequence[Sequence[int]]) -> bool:
    '''
    There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

    For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
    Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

def orangesRotting(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    '''
    You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

    0 representing an empty cell,
    1 representing a fresh orange, or
    2 representing a rotten orange.
    Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

    Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

def pacificAtlantic(heights: Sequence[Sequence[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    '''
    There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

    The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

    The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

    Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
